            <p> So the team worked long and hard to find a compound that can “upregulate” Ki-67 and help trigger what the scientists call “cell proliferation” to result in thicker, fuller eyebrows1 </p>
            <p>I remember it took forever for the team to finally get their hands on it, but they finally did: </p>
            <p>It’s called Biotinoyl Tripeptide-1...</p>
            <p class="ppr-5">A potent amino acid composition that can help achieve thicker, fuller brows...</p>
            <p class="ppr-15">In a clinical study on this compound, the length and thickness of the hair it was applied increased over 40%!</p>
            <p class="ppr-15">Not only did this compound increase thickness and length, but it improved hair “anchoring” in the scalp….</p>
